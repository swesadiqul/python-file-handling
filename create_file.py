# To create a new file in Python, use the open() method, with one of the following parameters
# "x" - Create - will create a file, returns an error if the file exist
# "a" - Append - will create a file if the specified file does not exist
# "w" - Write - will create a file if the specified file does not exist

# Create a file called "simple.txt"
'''
f = open('basic.txt', 'x')
'''
# Result: a new empty file is created!

# Create a new file if it does not exist
'''
w = open('myfile.txt', 'w')
